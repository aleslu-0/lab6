What did you learn? What did you know already?
-For task 1 I had to read up a lot on linked lists. For task 2, I knew SDL from the previous lab. Learned more about keyboard events and pointers.

What was difficult in the lab? How did you overcome it?
-I struggled a lot on task 1. Had to receive pointers from a classmate to progress. Task 2 took a long time, but wasn't very difficult.

How can the lab be improved?
-Task 1 and 2 could be separate labs, they aren't really connected. 

I estimate that I spent over 50 hours on the lab. I worked on and off for quite a while and lost track of how much time.
